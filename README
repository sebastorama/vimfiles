vimfiles.
My .vimrc is big and a lot confuse. The major part of the config is copied&pasted from other users.
Feel free to do the same :D

Instructions:

1 - git clone https://github.com/sebastorama/vimfiles.git ~/.vim
2 - ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
3 - Open vim and call "PluginInstall"
4 - Compile the command-t extension ( see *command-t-compile* https://github.com/wincent/Command-T )
5 - You'll be good to go (probably...)
